The guidelines section contains various guidelines for contributing to Authelia. We implement various guidelines via
automatic processes that will provide feedback in the PR, but this does not cover every situation. You will find both
those which are automated and those which are not in this section.

While it's expected that people aim to follow all of these guidelines we understand that there are logical exceptions to
all guidelines and if it makes sense we're likely to agree with you. So if you find a situation where it doesn't make
sense to follow one just let us know your reasoning when you make a PR if it's not obvious.

## General Guidelines

Some general guidelines include:

- It's recommended people wishing to contribute discuss their intended changes prior to contributing
  - This helps avoid people doubling up on contributions
  - This helps avoid conflicts between contributions
  - This helps avoid contributors wasting their percussion time in a contribution that may not be accepted
