There are three main methods to deploy *Authelia*.

1. [Docker](docker.md)
2. [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/introduction.md)
3. [Bare-Metal](bare-metal.md)

## Get Started

It's __*strongly recommended*__ that users setting up *Authelia* for the first time take a look at our
[Get Started](../prologue/get-started.md) guide. This takes you through various steps which are essential to
bootstrapping *Authelia*.
