The logging section tunes the logging settings.

## Configuration

{{< config-alert-example >}}

```yaml
log:
  level: 'info'
  format: 'text'
  file_path: ''
  keep_stdout: false
```

## Options

This section describes the individual configuration options.

### level

{{< confkey type="string" default="info" required="no" >}}

Defines the level of logs used by Authelia. This level can be set to `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`. When
setting level to `trace`, you will generate a large amount of log entries and expose the `/debug/vars` and
`/debug/pprof/` endpoints which should not be enabled in production.

```yaml
log:
  level: debug
```

### format

{{< confkey type="string" default="text" required="no" >}}

Defines the format of the logs written by Authelia. This format can be set to `json` or `text`.

```yaml
log:
  format: json
```

#### JSON format

```json
{"level":"info","msg":"Logging severity set to info","time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00+11:00"}
{"level":"info","msg":"Authelia is listening for non-TLS connections on 0.0.0.0:9091","time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00+11:00"}
```

#### Text format

```text
time="2020-01-01T00:00:00+11:00" level=info msg="Logging severity set to info"
time="2020-01-01T00:00:00+11:00" level=info msg="Authelia is listening for non-TLS connections on 0.0.0.0:9091"
```

### file_path

{{< confkey type="string" required="no" >}}

Logs can be stored in a file when file path is provided. Otherwise logs are written to standard output. When setting the
level to `debug` or `trace` this will generate large amount of log entries. Administrators will need to ensure that
they rotate and/or truncate the logs over time to prevent significant long-term disk usage.

If you include the value `%d` in the filename it will replace this value with a date time indicative of the time
the logger was initialized using [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) as the format which is
represented as `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00` in go.

#### File Path Examples

__Standard Example:__

```yaml
log:
  file_path: /config/authelia.log
```

__Date Time Example:__

```yaml
log:
  file_path: /config/authelia.%d.log
```

### keep_stdout

{{< confkey type="boolean" default="false" required="no" >}}

Overrides the behaviour to redirect logging only to the `file_path`. If set to `true` logs will be written to both
standard output, and the defined logging location.

```yaml
log:
  keep_stdout: true
```
