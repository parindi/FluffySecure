It is recommended in a production environment that you do not use the file notification system, and that it should only
be used for testing purposes. See one of [the other methods](introduction.md) for a production ready solution.

This method will use the plain text email template for readability purposes.

## Configuration

{{< config-alert-example >}}

```yaml
notifier:
  disable_startup_check: false
  filesystem:
    filename: '/config/notification.txt'
```

## Options

This section describes the individual configuration options.

### filename

{{< confkey type="string" required="yes" >}}

The file to add email text to. If it doesn't exist it will be created.
