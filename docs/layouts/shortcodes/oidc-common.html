### Common Notes

1. The [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) `client_id` parameter:
    1. This *__must__* be a unique value for every client.
    2. The value used in this guide is merely for demonstration purposes and you can theoretically use nearly any
       alphanumeric string.
2. The [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) `secret` parameter:
    1. The value used in this guide is merely for demonstration purposes and you *__should absolutely not__* use this in
       production and should instead utilize the
       [How Do I Generate Client Secrets]({{ $faq }}#how-do-i-generate-client-secrets) FAQ.
    2. This string may be stored as plaintext in the Authelia configuration but this behaviour is deprecated and is not
       guaranteed to be supported in the future. See the [Plaintext]({{ $faq }}#plaintext) guide for more
       information.
3. The Configuration example for Authelia is only a portion of the required configuration and it should be used as a
   guide in conjunction with the standard
   [OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider Configuration]({{ printf "%s/provider.md" $config }}) and
   [OpenID Connect 1.0 Clients Configuration]({{ printf "%s/clients.md" $config }}) guides.
